This folder contains some examples. The following of them have been used in the paper:

* `ProteinPhosphorylation` in Section 3.1
* `fceri_ji` in Section 3.2
* `Jak` in Section 3.3

For these three example, in addition to \*.ode and \*.obs files, we provide a file with the names of the variables in the bngl format.
